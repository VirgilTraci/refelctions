comparing two files using the command line was fun - i had not, so far, used the command line for much more that copy and paste 
functions so it was nice to know what I was doing with it for a change. 

A history function would be AMAZING!!

I have often thought the saving/committing to changes in your code is a tricky situation, especially when you code is not fully 
functional - it would be like fire-fighting every time you open your code. 

using git is far more basic than I originally thought. Its quite nice. I certainly didn't think that I would be accessing git 
through the terminal command line.

feeling more comfortable using git in the terminal - who knew this would be fun. 

I have completed the first lesson - roll on all of the others.
